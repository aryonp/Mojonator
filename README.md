# MOJONATOR

## Project Resistance

King Mojo Jojo is colonizing Singapore. You are part of the resistance to free Singapore from the cruel Mojo Jojo. Sadly, you don’t know how to raise arms.
But, you’re savvy in programming.

You gotta help resistance army to find the best routes to coup Cruel Mojo.
Mojo Jojo palace is located in Marina Bay Sands (search Google Maps for “Singapore 018972”).
In order to go there, you have to collect your weapons in 5 different locations. You have to start your journey from Changi airport, then collect your weapon at
Jurong Point MRT (Singapore 648886),
Bedok MRT (Singapore 467347),
Singapore Zoo (Singapore 729826),
Sentosa Cove (Singapore 098350)
and Punggol MRT (Singapore 828868).

However, you only have a limited amount of time so that you have to look for shortest route possible.

That points are the location of resistance bases. Each base must be visible on Maps, so that when you click on the icon, it will show information about the amount of armor and people (please use simple graphics). Then find the best routes using the Direction Service from Google Maps.

Your code should extend the Google Map example from here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/directions-draggable

The raid will be starting in 4 days. You have 2 days to finish this, so that the resistance leader can have another 2 days to prepare.
